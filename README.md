# hazel.rs

This project is a rewrite of [TheCherno's Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) in Rust, mostly as an exercise to get better at Rust.

Lots of liberties will undoubtedly be taken â€” partly in an attempt be more idiomatic, partly because certain C++ idioms are difficult or downright impossible to reproduce in Rust, and partly just 'cause personal preference.
